# HTML Button Code
We've design a simple button that can be used to accept payments or donations in $CENI.

Instructions:

1. Edit the following link, replacing mrhacking.eth with your ENS name or Metamask wallet address:

https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?exactField=input&outputCurrency=0xa4Ff1bfA01d4Bb13f24Cc026BEE40119Baf8fe1C&recipient=mrhacking.eth&chain=mainnet

2. Edit the button.html file, and change "example.com" in the a href to the above link that was modified in the previous step.

3. Host the HTML code or copy and paste from the start of the "<a href>" section, all the way down to the "</style>" section of the file.
